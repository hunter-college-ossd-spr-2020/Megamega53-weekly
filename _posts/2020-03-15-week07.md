For our project, we've decided to work on GoDot Engine. Personally, I'm comfortable with this decision as after looking through the Godot Engine, I found out how similar it was with the Unity Engine, which I had some experience with, especially with its interface. I want to contribute to this project through utilitizing my experience with another game engine (Unity), C language and at least other graphic design skills I have at my disposal. 

As for the contributions I've made this week, I've corrected a note about the location of a pizzeria in Open Street Map. The note asked if it was located in Princeton, but I corrected it and stated it was actually located in East Windsor near the US 130 route. I also made sure to add the address to the actual location of the pizzeria.
